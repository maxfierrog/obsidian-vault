### Functions of Random Variables

A function $f$ in a random variable $X$ is also defined as a random variable. It can therefore be said, for example, that $f(X) = X^2 = Y$.

We have that the random variable $Y = aX + b$ which is an affine function of some random variable $X$ has the expectation $E(Y) = aE(X) + b$. In the case where $b = -E(X)$, it follows that $E(Y) = 0$. Then, $Y$ is said to be a zero-mean random variable.

For some arbitrary $Y$ (not necessarily affine), we have that the following holds:

$$
E[g(X)] = \sum_{x} g(x)P_{X}(x)
$$

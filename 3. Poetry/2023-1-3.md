this time
because,
your eyes water my sweater
tears you shed, say,
it twists into the fabric
your damp skin,
can twist into the fabric
because we,
slowly work with water
this time because
you twist into the cashmere
yes, we slowly work with fabric,
this time
because from everything,
your eyes are filled with water
this time
twist into my sweater

I'm scared
growing panic 
my arms flail 
feel nothing
where am I?
I run
feel nothing
to open my eyes
and see you
I can't remember 
your face
help me
materialize yourself
before me
I want to
know where I am
I want
my arms 
to find you
if they flail
help me please
see you if
I open my eyes
I won't open
them
here

What it means to feel the truth
having lost my way
I lost it between my sheets

Sheets of paper, sheets of linen
Voice of linen,
your words trance my mind

Voice of linen, I try but
I cannot build you in my head

Your voice blossoms from the fabric
The arguments of knots, flows of threads,
textures of you in my head

Voice of linen,
what it means to feel your patterns
and lose my way in them

To feel something 
so mellow and intricate
to fall asleep dreaming
to hear your voice
